'''
Variable Manipulation(Declaration and initialization):
- Create three variables: `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`, and assign them integer values.
- Calculate the average of these three numbers and store it in a variable called `average`.
- Print out the result using an f-string.
'''

num1 = 4
num2 = 5
num3 = 6
average = (num1 + num2 + num3)/3

print(f"The average of numb1, num2 and num3 is {average}")
